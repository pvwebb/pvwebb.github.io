-------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="p">Viewing evolution as produced solely by survival of the fittest without involvement from God or any other guiding force leaves no room for the development of cognition based on reality.<div class="footnote">"Can Naturalistically Evolved Human Minds Be Trusted To Give True Beliefs About Reality?" <http://www.reasons.org/darwins-doubt></div> In fact, if one assumes survival of the fittest as the only driving force, human emotion motivates the opposite belief. A sense of purpose in life motivates the desire to survive. Lack of purpose greater than oneself encourages suicidal tendencies when failure makes life seem useless.</div>If survival of the fittest is the only driving force in what caused humanity, then human life has no purpose. Again, if one assumes survival of the fittest as the only driving force, then denying reality and believing in a purpose in life promotes survival.

Thus, if humans developed solely from survival of the fittest, then such development encourages denying reality. If this is the case, then how can we trust any of our knowledge as based on reality? In particular, can we trust a scientific model that leads to the conclusion that our knowledge developed through a process that encourages denying reality?

Sigmund Freud explained faith in God as wishful thinking (*The Future of an Illusion*, 1927), but why do people have the desire for God? Hunger drives a person to eat and thirst to drink. Sexual desires drive people to procreate. These desires lead to a reality. Why did people throughout the centuries have the desire to worship if it leads to denying reality? Either humanity has no basis for knowing reality, or something more significant than survival of the fittest guided the development of human cognition and desire toward knowing reality.

If we limit origin of human life to survival of the fittest, then we commit intellectual suicide by undermining cognition having a basis in reality. If we claim more than survival of the fittest explains the origin of human life, then what does? Does that something else give us purpose in life or an object worthy of worship? God, as presented in Christianity, gives us purpose and a worthy object of worship.
