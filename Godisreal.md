-----------------------------

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;color:windowtext">How can someone limit reality only to what one can encounter through the senses or explain logically? It's arrogant to think that reality can't exist beyond one's capability to sense or understand. You wouldn't teach your dog algebra. What makes humans so superior that nothing exists beyond their ability to understand?However, since we cannot understand God intellectually, our ability to demonstrate God's existence intellectually is next to impossible, especially when it comes to convincing someone who doubles God's existence. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;color:windowtext">If knowing God depended on our ability, being a skeptic or agnostic would make the best sense. But, what about God's ability to make Himself know to us? When you get a new pet, how to you get acquainted with him? Do you tell him your life story, all about what you do for a living, </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt">\*\*\*\*\*\*\*</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;color:green">If God created everything, why would He create evil?</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt">This question views evil as if it exists independent of good.Evil without good is like a hole without the ground around it.Evil is the absence of good or the corruption of good ([Romans 3:20](http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Romans+3:20); [4:15](http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Romans+4:15); [5:13](http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Romans+5:13); [7:7-10](http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Romans+7:7-10)).The same logic argument asks, "Since God is light and is present everywhere, why is there darkness?" The statement God is light ([1 John 1:5](http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1+John+1:5)) is a figure of speech meaning knowledge comes from God. We can restate the question, "Since God is all-knowing and present everywhere, why is there ignorance." </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt">Ignorance allows us to learn. Similarly, a deficient and corrupt character gives room to develop a character based on Christ's example ([Romans 8:29](http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Romans+8:29)).To have good character one must want to be good. Otherwise, goodness is pretense rather than genuine. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;color:green">Couldn't God create people to choose good each time?</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt">If no one ever chose evil, then would doing good really be a choice? For people to choose to be good, the choice to be bad must be real. How could the choice be real if people couldn't choose otherwise? </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt;color:green">What does God value so much that He allows evil as a choice?</span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt">Merely the ability to choose isn't worth allowing evil. What does choosing grant that's important enough for evil to exist?God values the intrinsic person ([1 Peter 1:6-11](http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1+Peter+1:6-11)).He wants a person to desire to follow Him. He wants a person to be motivated by the same motives that motivate Him. Each time parents have a child there's a risk that the child might rebel against the parents. Yet, parents still take the chance because they desire children who love them, who are obedient and loyal to them. Parents could try to force their children to be that way. But, even if they had the ability to do so, it wouldn't be the same as children who choose to love. A wife can buy her own presents, but it isn't the same as when her husband buys them for her. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt">God makes it as easy as possible for us to choose integrity. He came to us as a perfect human being to die as a sacrifice for our sins, but we must choose to receive this forgiveness. He sent His Spirit to live in us and desire good within us, but we must allow Him to permeate our lives. </span>

<span style="font-size:14.0pt">Similar to the question of evil is the question about suffering:</span>
