-----------------------------------------

<div class="p">For a man's ways are in full view of the Lord,
 and he examines all his paths.

 Proverbs 5:21, NIV
 Context: Proverbs 5:1-23</div>Do you remember singing as a child the song, "Oh, be careful little eyes what you see?" It goes on to say, "For the Father, up above, is looking down in love." Children attending church learn every action is in full view of God. Yet, the adolescent often forgets God is watching. How to control newly developed sexuality confuses him/her. The tendency is to trust one's desires over the guidance of God and parents. Even when adolescents remain chaste, they struggle with their thoughts, especially in a world that exposes them to temptation. Human nature denies uncomfortable thoughts rather than recognizing God knows our thoughts better than we do, and He will help us if we ask (Matthew 7:7-11).

<div class="p">The context of this verse in <cite class="bibleref" title="Proverbs 5:1-23">Proverbs 5</cite> references hidden sexual sins. A good goal for every Christian is to live life aware of God's presence. In fact, King Solomon wrote it this way: Trust in the Lord with all your heart
 and lean not on your own understanding;
 in all your ways acknowledge him,
 and he will make your paths straight.
(Proverbs 3:5-6, NIV)
