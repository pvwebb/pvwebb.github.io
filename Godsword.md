---------------------------------------------------

<div class="p">"For My thoughts are not your thoughts,
 and your ways are not My ways."
 ⌊This is⌋ the Lord's declaration.
 "For as heaven is higher than earth,
 so My ways are higher than your ways,
 and My thoughts than your thoughts.
 ...
 (v.11) so My word that comes from My mouth
 will not return to Me empty,
 but it will accomplish what I please,
 and will prosper in what I send it ⌊to do⌋."
 (Isaiah 55:8, 9, 11, HCSB)

 Context: Isaiah 55:1-13</div>Christians commonly quote verse 11, but consider the context? Although the meaning is plain, the context clearly and simply addresses a deep philosophical question. How can finite human thoughts understand God whose thoughts are infinite? Because of the vast difference between God and humanity, it's often said communication with God is impossible.

However, in verse 11, God says His communication accomplishes what He wants it to. Thus, we can understand what He intends to tell to us. Although we can't understand God, God understands us and establishes a relationship with us on our level. Consider that a dog or cat can't understand the human mind. You can't teach them calculus or differential equations, nor can you teach them to be a medical doctor. Yet, people establish relationships with their pets all the time.

When God says His word will do what He wants it to do, we can be assured that, not only is God capable of communicating with us, He has successfully done so. It is up to us to pay attention.
