------------------------------

The idea that truth is relative is popular today because people believe that this concept of truth is more tolerant by saying that no one has a monopoly on truth. However, if you look at the full implications of this idea, the result is quite the opposite. When there is no absolute reference for truth then truth depends on who can yell the loudest, who can persuade the most people, or who can display the most might. When people believe that truth is relative, the tendency is to slander and silence the opposition.

<div class="p">On the other hand, absolute truth can only exist with an absolute all-knowing being. As human beings we fall short of understanding absolute truth, but because absolute truth exists with God, what those who oppose us believe or say does not change truth. Neither can we say that we have a monopoly on truth. Only God does. As Christians, God has revealed Himself perfectly in the Bible, but we do not understand it perfectly. Jesus stated the tolerance that a Christian should have when He said: <sup>43 </sup><font color="#A00000">"You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'</font> <sup>44 </sup><font color="#A00000">But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,</font> <sup>45 </sup><font color="#A00000">that you may be sons of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.</font> <sup>46 </sup><font color="#A00000">If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that?</font> <sup>47 </sup><font color="#A00000">And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that?</font> <sup>48 </sup><font color="#A00000">Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</font> (Matthew 5:43-48, NIV)

 Thus, absolute truth has more ability to tolerate different people than relative truth.</div>How does the person who believes truth is absolute answer the question, "If a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it, did it make a sound?" The scientist will say that the physical phenomena that we hear as sound will still exist even if no one hears it. The Christian can say that God hears the sound that every tree makes when it falls in the forest, based on Matthew 6:26, 28-30; 10:29; Luke 12:6.
