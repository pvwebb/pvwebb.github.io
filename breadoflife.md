-------------------------------

 John 6:25-59 <div class="p">Jesus' statement that He was the Bread of Life came after He fed the five thousand with the five loaves and two small fish (John 6:1-15). The crowd essentially presented the same three temptations (John 6:15, 26, 30-31) to Christ, as did Satan. Within the context of his own life, Jesus essentially paraphrases Deuteronomy 8:3, His answer to turn the stones to bread in John 6:27: Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. On him God the Father has placed his seal of approval. (John 6:27, NIV)

 </div><div class="p">Other key verses in the passage are the following: Then they asked him, "What must we do to do the works God requires?"  
  
 Jesus answered, "The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent." (John 6:28-29, NIV)

Then Jesus declared, "I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will never be thirsty. (John 6:35, NIV)

I tell you the truth, he who believes has everlasting life. I am the bread of life. Your forefathers ate the manna in the desert, yet they died. But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat and not die. I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world." (John 6:47-51, NIV)

This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your forefathers ate manna and died, but he who feeds on this bread will live forever. (John 6:58, NIV)

 This has obvious connections to the Last Supper during Passover just before Christ was crucified. Paul referred to Christ as the Passover Lamb (1 Corinthians 5:7). Jesus was born in Bethlehem (the House of Bread). A major part of Jesus being the Bread of Life is that He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins that restores our relationship with God (John 6:53-58; Romans 5:6-8; 8:3; 2 Corinthians 5:21; Galatians 3:13; Hebrews 9:28; 1 Peter 2:24; 3:18).</div>  </div>- [Back to home page.](noframesindex.html)
