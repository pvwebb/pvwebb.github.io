--------------------------------

<div class="p">Such confidence as this \[in ourselves\] is ours through Christ before God. Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from God. He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant—not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. (2 Corinthians 3:4-6 NIV)

 How can we have self-confidence as Paul describes? Many evangelical Christians lack self-confidence. An emphasis on depravity (everyone falls short of God's standards) without emphasizing God's provision in this life, leads to poor self-confidence. Complete confidence in God's provision depends on His absolute sovereignty. Anything less leads to an incomplete gospel that tells how Christ rescued us from Hell, but not how God provides for us here on earth.</div>Many have sought to correct for low self-confidence by downplaying our sinful nature and the need to repent without learning what the Bible says about self-confidence and daily life. This naive optimism ignores that we don't know the future and need God's guidance, providence, and correction. It takes the approach if people keep trying, though they may first fail, they will eventually succeed. James clearly warns against self-confidence based on one's own plans (James 4:13-17) .

Some parents raise children to believe in themselves without being plagued with feelings of guilt and sin. However, children can become self-centered and come to believe the world revolves around them. They want their own way and are unaccustomed to criticism. When teachers punish them or other students criticize or reject them, the result is anger sometimes to the point of violence.

<div class="p">We can have confidence in Christ directing our lives. This confidence comes from God's all-powerful ability, not from our limited abilities. Just as children gain security from a strong marriage and family relationship between their mother and father, Christians gain confidence from God's sovereignty and His ability to guide, correct, and provide for us. We don't know the future, but God does. Of course, belief that God loves us and desires what's best for us<div class="footnote">(Matthew 7:7-12)</div> is fundamental to genuine confidence. Along with this, God is able to make sure that we receive what is best even when it doesn't seem that way<div class="footnote">(1 Thessalonians 5:16-18; Romans 8:28-39)</div>. </div><div class="p">Obeying God gives us this confidence. God revealed His will in the Bible. Reading the Bible regularly lets us know what it says. However, knowing what the Bible says does little good without a willingness to do what God says in His Word. In fact, we can't really understand the Bible without a willingness to do what it says<div class="footnote">(John 7:14-19)</div>. If we let selfish desires influence our interpretation of Scripture, then we will twist its meaning to something different than God intended<div class="footnote">(2 Peter 3:16)</div>. </div><div class="p">Sometimes we think we must know all God plans for our entire lives to do God's will. This might be true if fulfilling God's will were completely up to us. We need to have the confidence that God works through us<div class="footnote">(Ephesians 2:10; Philippians 2:13)</div>. If we truly desire to do God's will, He will guide<div class="footnote">(Psalms 23:1-6)</div> , correct<div class="footnote">(Hebrews 12:5-11)</div> , and enable us. Remember God sees and values who we are on the inside<div class="footnote">(1 Samuel 16:7)</div> while people only observe the external. God will use external circumstances to shape who we are inside<div class="footnote">(Romans 8:29)</div>. When we put too much value on external circumstances<div class="footnote">(Matthew 6:19-34)</div>, the situations God puts us in may seem cruel. God's goal in this temporary life is for us to develop the character that persists eternally into the next life with Him in Heaven<div class="footnote">(John 14:1-3; Romans 8:30)</div>. </div><div class="p" id="footnotes"></div><script src="js/footnotes.js" type="text/javascript"></script><div class="copy">©2003 Perry Vernon Webb.
