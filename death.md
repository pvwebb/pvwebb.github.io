--------------------------------------

### The Brevity of Life

 Job 14:1-2; Psalm 39:4-6; 89:47-48; 90:5-6; 144:4; 1 Peter 1:24-25; James 4:14 Our ultimate answer to life and death rests in God's salvation in Jesus Christ (John 3:16; 1 John 2:17). Even if you do not believe this, our time in this life is limited. Even people like my grandmother who lived to the age of ninety said that life was brief before she died. People have tried to handle their mortality in many ways. Some people tried to extend how long people remembered them by having many children and memorizing long genealogies to which their name was added. People have done such things as writing books, building buildings, and achievements that make a positive contribution to society, but even society has its end (1 John 2:17). Today, in the USA people begin living as if they will live forever. Then, when life is half over and they realize how little of life is left, they face mid-life crisis.

<div class="p">Too often we view our life on earth as if it were a tangible object that we could store or preserve (Luke 12:16-21). In many ways life is like love. It is in giving ourselves away to God and others that we find ourselves <div class="footnote">(Matthew 10:39; 16:25; Mark 8:35; Luke 9:24; 17:33; John 12:25; Romans 12:1-2)</div>.</div>### A Full Life

 John 10:10 <div class="p">Salvation has a much larger impact than what happens after death. With salvation, God sets us apart from the world as His possession <div class="footnote">(John 17:13-19; 1 Corinthians 6:9; Ephesians 4:22-24; 5:25-27; Colossians 1:21-23; 3:12-17; 1 Thessalonians 4:3,7; 5:23-24; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 1:8-9; 2:20-21; Hebrews 12:10; 1 Peter 1:14-16; 2:9-10)</div>. As God's possession, He works through us to accomplish His new creation <div class="footnote">(2 Corinthians 5:17; Ephesians 2:8-10; Philippians 2:12-13)</div>. Thus, when we let God work through us, what we do in this life becomes a part of God's eternal purpose <div class="footnote">(Psalm 138:8; Romans 8:28-30; 1 Corinthians 15:58; Ephesians 1:3-14; 3:7-13)</div>.</div>### Life after Death

 1 Corinthians 15:50-57 <div class="p">Someone might say, "How do you know anything about life after death? Do you know someone who has ever been to Heaven or who has died and come back?" But we who know Jesus Christ know someone who has done just this <div class="footnote">(John 3:13; 21:1, 4, 7; Acts 1:3-9)</div>. Not only has He told us about Heaven and life after death <div class="footnote">(Matthew 22:30; Mark 12:25)</div>, but also He has provided the means for us to go to Heaven (John 3:14-17). He also told us the consequences of rejecting His offer (John 3:17-21; Luke 16:27-31).</div><div class="p" id="footnotes"></div><script src="js/footnotes.js" type="text/javascript"></script>  </div>- [Back to home page.](index.html)
