--------------------------------------------------

<div class="p">The eye cannot say to the hand, "I don't need you!" And the head cannot say to the feet, "I don't need you!" On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,... (1 Corinthians 12:21-22, NIV)

</div>During a power interruption, the room became pitch black in the school for the blind cafeteria. My father-in-law, a volunteer at the school, could only stand there until a blind student took his hand and said, "Don't worry Mr. Chisholm. We'll get you out of here."

Our society resolves how we treat the handicapped by laws to encourage businesses to accommodate the handicapped. While these laws help external conditions, the problem is the attitude that a disability is something necessary to tolerate. The fact is that God has a purpose in differences, whether hereditary or circumstances, whether spiritual gifts or the result of bad choices. People should neither [boast about advantages](pride.md) nor [excuse themselves because of disadvantages](confidence.md). God has a purpose and plan for each individual (1 Corinthians 12:4-11) to fit into His all-encompassing plan (Ephesians 1:11).

We need to look at an individual's advantages rather than his/her disadvantages. What can that person do better than other people can? This thought values a person highly. It promotes the desire to be accommodating because of that value. Of course, to do this is discriminating. It is correctly discriminating to the highest degree. It is rightly choosing a person because of who he or she is. Some of the people who have made very important contributions to our society have had severe disadvantages while some that have had the most ability have been the most destructive. We cannot afford to neglect anyone. Everyone is valuable in God's sight.
