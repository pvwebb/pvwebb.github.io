-----------------------------------

<div class="p">"...always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth." (2 Timothy 3:7, ESV)

 Context: <cite class="bibleref" title="2 Timothy 3">2 Timothy 3</cite></div>This phrase, 2 Timothy 3:7, typifies a attitude that's also a trend today. Previously, Modernism expected to find truth through science. However, the more people learned the more the limits of human knowledge became apparent. First, morality fell victim to the concept of no absolutes. Then, objective reality fell to the same thinking. The heart of this philosophy disallows a sovereign God. If people can't agree on truth, then truth must be relative. Not only do Postmodernists admit to not arriving at a knowledge of the truth, they also deny the possibility.

Paul's answer is at the end of the chapter (2 Timothy 3:14-17). The Bible is God's revelation to us. While human knowledge is limited (1 Corinthians 13:12), we can trust God who knows absolutely.
