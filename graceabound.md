<div class="p">What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? (Romans 6:1, ESV)

Context: <cite class="bibleref" title="Romans 6">Romans 6</cite>)</div><div class="p">Since God saved us through grace (Ephesians 2:8-9), are we now free to live immorally? Answering, "Yes," to this question is what Dietrich Bonhauffer, the Lutheran priest executed for plotting against Adolph Hitler, called "cheap grace."

No, because we can't earn grace any more that we earn the right to be children. But, just as parents discipline their children, God disciplines His (Hebrews 12:5-11). As parents, it's difficult to concentrate on attitude rather than behavior. But, God, who knows our hearts, brings [change from the inside out](looksattheheart.html). Thus, a child of God who seeks to live immorally will be as unhappy as a rebellious child with parents diligent to amend his behavior.
