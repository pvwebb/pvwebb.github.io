----------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="p">Therefore, since through God's mercy we have this ministry, we do not lose heart. Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake. For God, who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ. (2 Corinthians 4:1-6, NIV)

</div>There are many different ways we can be tempted to make it easier to convince people. People often believe that, as long as they are achieving good, the means don't matter. However, for the Christian the means are the end. Through the circumstances in life and what we do in this life, God conforms us to the image of Christ (Romans 8:28-29). Being honest and open expresses God's character. God seeks to shape our inner character to Christ's, not our outward appearance. In our outward appearance we are becoming old and are approaching death, but for the Christian our inner character is what lasts in Heaven (1 John 2:17).
