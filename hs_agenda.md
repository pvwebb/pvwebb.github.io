<div class="p">While there is not question that our society has treated homosexuals unfairly, being treated unfairly does not mean that one has the correct solution to stop this unfair treatment. When we look at what politically active homosexuals are saying, we see that the issue is much larger than fair treatment. Read the following quotation: <div class="p">#### FEMALE BOY LOVER GETS PRISON

 The daughter of former homophobic Republican Congress Member John G. Schmitz will do time for her terrible crime: loving a boy.

 Mary Katherine LeTourneau was on probation after admitting she had sex with a 13-year-old former student whose child she bore. The 35-year-old former Seattle elementary school teacher was freed in January after serving six months in prison. The terms of her release, however, included she have NO contact with the boy, who remains nameless.

 Fate is a funny thing. In early February, while Seattle police were looking for a car that had nearly run down a police officer, they came upon another car with its lights on and windows steamed up. Police recognized LeTourneau from photos. Her attorney told reporters his client and the boy were merely talking. She's now in jail once again. I guess there's no consideration in our legal society for a woman to talk with the father of her child.

 I really don't understand why such a fuss is being made about this incident. News reports claim the boy was very mature for his age. While the law says a minor cannot "consent" to sexual acts, we all know that physically and emotionally, they can make a choice. Can or should that choice be made to have sex acts with an adult, why is the ADULT always the one to get the boot? In this case at hand, it really doesn't appear Mary held a gun to the boy's head and said, "Fxxx<sup>1</sup> me, fxxx<sup>1</sup> me!" If the boy was abuse, harassed, or coerced, then Mary should be punished. If this is something they both wanted to do, que cera cera!

 The only thing about this incident that pisses me off is Mary left her teaching skills on the street when she had sex with the boy, as it is evident no rubber was used. That's the real crime here!

The issue at stake is even larger than sexual abuse of minors. It is a battle over what our government funded public schools, libraries, and other institutions teach our children. It is a clash between teaching Judeo-Christian standards of morality (often the same or similar in other religions) and teaching the concept portrayed in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, where children learn unrestrained sexual expression.</div><div class="p">The impact of enforcing equal employment opportunities for homosexuals is far greater than protecting the rights of homosexuals from discrimination. The following quotation shows the impact it has upon Canada. Just last year, the British Columbia College of Teachers (BCCT) refused to accredit a teacher education program offered by Trinity Western University (TWU) — a Christian school. The reason? TWU requires its students to sign a code of conduct that prohibits homosexual behavior among other things. According to a BCCT lawyer, students "need to be exposed to other lifestyles."<sup>9</sup>

 Likewise, King's College in Edmonton — another Christian institution — fired a lab instructor because of his openly homosexual conduct. The individual filed suit against the province of Alberta, charging that it refused to extend human rights protection to homosexuality. In April, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that legal protection (preference) must be extended immediately to Alberta's homosexual community and that sexual orientation must be part of the province's Human Rights Code. One Supreme Court justice said, " . . . I believe that judicial intervention is warranted to correct a democratic process that has acted improperly."<sup>10</sup> Get it? The people of Canada can't be trusted to make their own decisions.

 Dr. Ted Morton, a professor of political science at the University of Calgary, had this to say about the two cases mentioned above: "There will be strong pressures to define and isolate any private — especially religion-based — educational institutions that do not embrace 'gay positive' policies. The argument has already been made before the courts in Canada that 'equality rights' are more important than freedom of religion and freedom of association."<sup>11</sup>

 This is a quotation from the Focus on the Family URL: [http://www.family.org/docstudy/newsletters/a0001935.html](http://web.archive.org/web/20000622094557/http://www.family.org/docstudy/newsletters/a0001935.html). The Salvation Army already has a conflict with the city of San Francisco because of its providing domestic partner benefits to homosexual employees and demanding companies who do business with the city of San Francisco to do the same.</div><div class="p">Granting equal rights protection for an unethical behavior threatens the very heart of religious freedom. Ethical behavior is fundamental to religion. The first amendment to the Constitution of the United States is as follows: Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

 The purpose of the amendment was to allow individuals to practice their religion without persecution by the government or an established government religion. When our government supports viewpoints that oppose religion while at the same time excludes viewpoints that support religion under the guise of "separation of church and state," this in effect is the same religious persecution that the writers of the first amendment were trying to prevent.</div>### Links to another site that further discusses these issues:
