------------------------

<div class="p">After he said this, he showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw the Lord. (John 20:20, NIV)

The only physical identification the scriptures give for Jesus is the scars on His hands, feet, and side. Apparently, His appearance was ordinary for his day. Judas had to point Jesus out<div class="footnote">(Matthew 26:48-49; Mark 14:44-45)</div> from among His disciples. In Jesus' conversation with those arresting Him (John 18:4-8), they apparently didn't recognize Him. </div>One summer, the black Baptist church in Borger, Texas, asked my mother to play the piano during Vacation Bible School. In the early 1960's, my brother and I were the only white children there. We colored a picture of Jesus. To my surprise, children colored Jesus black. With a child's inquisitive mind I couldn't avoid asking why they colored Jesus black. The loving and understanding teacher explained that we don't know what Jesus looked like. Jesus came as a human being just like you and me. The children were coloring Jesus to look like themselves.

<div class="p">If Jesus had come as a Roman or Greek, we would have marble statues of Him. Jesus came as a Jew, and we don't even have a verbal description of Him, whether He was short or tall, fat or thin, dark or light, or whether His hair was long or short. Physical appearance is unimportant<div class="footnote">(Acts 10:34-35; Leviticus 19:15; Deuteronomy 1:17; 16:19; 2 Chronicles 19:7; Romans 2:11; Ephesians 6:9; 1 Timothy 5:21; James 2:1,9)</div> to God. What is important is our heart (1 Samuel 16:7).</div><div class="p" id="footnotes"></div><script src="js/footnotes.js" type="text/javascript"></script><div class="copy">Â©2000 Perry Vernon Webb.
