Dear Mr. President,
Homosexual issues polarize our nation. You will have tremendous pressure to support political solutions. However, the non-divisive way to deal with homosexual issues is to focus on scientific research as opposed to political solutions. Research allows people to gain necessary information to form their own viewpoint instead of conforming to a politically correct viewpoint. The difference in viewpoints is deeper than politics. The difference rests in basic presuppositions of whether homosexuality is genetic or learned. Scientific research would provide the answers, not legislation.

As a Christian, I believe God's truth is absolute and don't fear honest scientific investigation. However, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) appears to fear open discussion with people released from the homosexual lifestyle. The APA canceled their scheduled debate on two questions, "Is reorientation therapy ethical?" and "Can it be effective?" (http://www.leaderu.com/orgs/narth/debate.html), because the opposition refused to participate due to political implications.

Relying on scientific evidence should satisfy both those opposed to and those adhering to the homosexual lifestyle. However, if evidence supports that homosexuality is a learned behavior, isn't influencing children about homosexuality in public schools a practice that could alter their sexual orientation?

Sincerely,
Perry Webb
