<div class="p">John 13:1b: "Having loved his own who were in the world, he now showed them the full extent of his love." (John 13:1b, NIV)

 Context: John 13:1-17</div>Inside a candy wrapper was the statement, "Dare to love completely." I wondered if the author knew what it really meant. I thought of John's introduction to Passion Week in John 13. "The full extent of His love" refers to more than a single event. Christ's life showed us his love. But, He showed us the full extent of his love during Passion Week, beginning with washing His disciples' feet and ending with His death on the cross.

Inconvenience and suffering exemplify the love Christ showed. From the beginning Christ left His place as God in Heaven to become a carpenter, an ordinary man ([Philippians 2:6-8](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2:6-8)). Exhaustion typified His ministry ([Mark 1:32-37](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+1:32-37); [John 4:6](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+4:6)). When Jesus washed His disciples' feet, He demonstrated with His actions what He had done when He became a man. Tired from traveling, no one wanted to wash their own feet much less someone else's, but Jesus did.

While to some "Dare to love completely" might be a cliché, to me it's chilling. It's a challenge, a goal, which shows me how much farther I have to go.
