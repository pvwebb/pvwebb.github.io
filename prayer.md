### My Prayer

Lord,

To You belong all power, honor, and glory.
 (Revelation 4:11; 5:12-13; 7:11-12)

May I allow You to rule my mind, my desires, and my actions,
 (Deuteronomy 6:5; Psalm 37:4-5)

just as the whole universe is under Your control.
 (Matthew 6:25-34; 10:29-31; Luke 12:6-7,22-31)

May You alter people's schemes to fulfill Your will.
 (Psalm 33:10-11; Proverbs 16:1,9; 19:21; Ecclesiastes 7:29)

Especially the schemes of those who intend to harm,
 may You work for good what they intend as evil.
 (Genesis 45:5; 50:20; Proverbs 21:30)

Forgive me of my selfishness, senselessness, and lack of consideration.
 Help be to be sensitive to Your Spirit
 (Ephesians 4:29-32; 1 Thessalonians 5:16-22)

and to be considerate of other people.
 (Philippians 2:1-11)

I ask this in Jesus name. Amen.
