------------------------------------------

<div class="p">How can you say, "We are wise,
 And we possess the Instruction of the Lord"?
 ...
 See, they reject the word of the Lord,
 So their wisdom amounts to nothing.
 (Jeremiah 8:8-9, JPS Tanakh)

 Context: Jeremiah 8)</div>The Bible is the best selling book in the Western World. Almost every family has one. Yet of all those Bibles, how many have been read? Often, people buy Bibles like they buy exercise machines. They intend to use them, but end up setting them aside to collect dust. How can people follow the instructions in the Bible if they don't know what it says? Too often people treat God's instructions for life the same way they do instructions for assembling a toy. So goes the saying, "When all else fails, read the instructions."

Even knowing the Bible isn't enough without a willingness to follow God's instructions in it. Many who teach the Bible in accredited universities discount parts of the Bible as inaccurate. However, these scholars have no consensus on what parts are inaccurate. On the other hand, many people profess that the entire Bible is true, but live as if only selective parts are true. Knowing about the Bible without doing what it says is unproductive knowledge.
