---------------------------------------------------------------

### Special Revelation

Special revelation is how God has revealed Himself through unique or particular events in history (Hebrews 1:1-2) as opposed to His revelation through the general nature of our world (Romans 1:20). The Bible is special revelation from God. The uniqueness of the virgin birth and resurrection of Jesus Christ are essential to Christianity.

### Scientific Models

Scientific models of our world are based on the assumption that we can explain everything with general principles that we can derive experimentally through repeatable events. Thus, science assumes without proof that unique unrepeatable events do not occur. Otherwise, these events would not fit into the scientific models. Yet are we really willing to believe that nothing is unique in what we see in life including our own unique existence?

Science has trouble with the Biblical concept of creation because it is a unique event. Many scientist would rather say that universe has no beginning or end. They would like to believe that, even if the universe had a starting point such as a Big Bang, the expanding universe would eventually contract and collapse to repeat the Big Bang in a never beginning or ending process. This is all based on the belief that unique events such as a beginning or end cannot occur.

Our scientific models have difficulty dealing with a single universe. If we had one universe created by God and another not created by God, then we could compare the two and tell the difference. However, by the definition of universe, there is only one. We need to remember that a model is only as good as its ability to represent reality. It is a misuse of the model to try to distort reality to fit the model.

### Logical Proofs: Deductive and Inductive Reasoning

All deductive proofs must start with assumptions, often called axioms or postulates. Inductive proofs require testing every single case. A contradiction in just one case is sufficient for disproof in inductive reasoning. While someone may be able to evaluate every case theoretically in such disciplines as mathematics, only God has this capability considering every case in the real world. Thus, people cannot prove anything that is real without first starting with a set of beliefs.
