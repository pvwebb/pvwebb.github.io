----------------------------

<div class="p">Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. (James 1:15 NIV)

 Context: James 1:12-18</div>Have you pursued a desire only to have it fall short of its potential and leave you frustrated? God's intention for our desires is to seek Him (Psalm 37:4). However, God gave us the ability to choose how (James 1:13-14) we attempt to fulfill our desires. God revealed how we can seek and know Him in the Bible. For us to seek to fulfill our desires otherwise is sin. To do otherwise can be very inviting (James 1:14). Sin can often promise great pleasure, but ends in frustration and disappointment.

We are not the only ones that suffer from our sins. Our failure to live consistent with God's ideal purpose also disappoints Him. Each sin grieves God. When a person rejects His offer of forgiveness through His Son and embraces sin, it is especially saddening to God, who is all-knowing and all-powerful. Just as sin causes a person to be born spiritually dead, having a stillborn child is excruciating heartbreak to parents. It is small compared to the heartbreak of the infinitely loving God. Just as the risk of losing a child should not cause us to avoid having children, losing people did not stop God from creating people.

A receptionist who lost a baby commented, "My dogs are my children. Isn't that enough?"  
  
 I replied, "They aren't likely to outlive you like a child hopefully will."  
  
 Not long afterward she was pregnant. This time she bore a healthy child.

Why does God allow disappointment? God rejoices when we please Him. Even more, He rejoices when a person comes to Him (Luke 15:7, 10, 20-24) for forgiveness and new life. Rejoicing parents at the birth of a child is only a small indication of God's joy.

Not all disappointment is the result of our own sin, but the state of fallen humanity (<cite class="bibleref" title="Genesis 3">Genesis 3</cite>) makes it inevitable in this life.
