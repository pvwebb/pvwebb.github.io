--------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="p">Jesus replied, "Friend, do what you came for."

Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him. With that, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.

"Put your sword back in its place," Jesus said to him, "for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.

 Matthew 26:50-52, NIV</div><div class="p">Peter<div class="footnote">(John 18:10)</div> had taken Jesus' previous statement about swords<div class="footnote">(Luke 22:36-38)</div> literally. Peter was willing to die fighting, but was unwilling to face arrest without a fight. In this situation the disciples fled<div class="footnote">(Matthew 26:56)</div>. Later Peter denied knowing Christ<div class="footnote">(Matthew 26:69-75)</div> rather than risk being discovered. We cannot take this passage to say that Christians should never fight in a war for any reason. It does tell us something about religious battles. Jesus made it clear that He did not come to bring peace<div class="footnote">(Matthew 10:34-36)</div>, but this struggle is not with might to force people to submit to God<div class="footnote">(Zechariah 4:6)</div>. It is a battle to gain submission of the inner person to God<div class="footnote">(Luke 17:20-21)</div>.</div><div class="p" id="footnotes"></div><script src="js/footnotes.js" type="text/javascript"></script> </div>- [Back to home page.](index.md)
