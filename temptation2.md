--------------------------------------

John also mentioned three temptations in 1 John 2:15: "For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world." (NASB) It is easy to associate *the lust* (desires) *of the eyes* with the mind (intellect), truth, and appearance. The other two temptations are not as clearly distinguished. In fact, the three parts of the inner person are not always distinct from one another, nor are they necessarily all the parts of the inner person. We can relate *the desires of the flesh* to the will and decision making based upon Paul's use of flesh as the natural unregenerate will and efforts of people (Romans 8:1-13; 1 Corinthians 3:1-3; 2 Corinthians 10:1-7; Galatians 3:1-6; Galatians 5:13-26; Philippians 3:3-11). The word *life* in *pride of life* translates the word bios. The word *bios* relates to the functional aspects of life, to the manner and means of life. Here the *pride of life* refers to the pride in making a living. We can relate it to the emotional aspect of the inner person, to hunger, thirst, and the basic desires to sustain life.

Can we see the same three parts in Satan's temptation of Eve in Genesis 3:1-6? In Genesis 3:6 *good for food* relates to hunger and the emotional part of the inner person. *The eye* and *wisdom* both relate to the intellect. Satan's statement to Eve in Genesis 3:1, "Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?," relates to the will (volition) or decision making part of the inner person. It is challenging Eve with the pride of her ability to choose.
