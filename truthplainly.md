----------------------------------------------------

<div class="p">Therefore, since through God&#146;s mercy we have this ministry, we do not lose heart. Rather, we have renounced secret and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to every man&#146;s conscience in the sight of God. And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. For we do not preach ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus&#146; sake. For God, who said, &#147;Let light shine out of darkness,&#148; a made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.

 (2 Corinthians 4:1-6, NIV)</div>What methods should we use to attract people to Christ? Jesus wants us to fish for people, but that doesn't justify deception when we do. We sow seeds of genuine faith when we approach people honestly. Besides not tricking people, it means not distorting God's word to make it easier to accept. It means not keeping secrets from unbelievers. In some countries, persecution might necessitate secrets about when and where Christians worship, but genuine Christianity doesn't keep secrets about faith and how we worship. All we believe is open to non-Christians.
