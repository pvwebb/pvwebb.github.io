-------------------------------------------

<div class="p">Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. (John 14:6, NIV)

</div>The way, the truth, and the life relate to three parts of the inner person. *Way*, also meaning *road* or *path*, relates to a person's will (volition) or decision making. Even more extensively it relates to a person's behavior or conduct. *Truth*, while it is absolute in God, relates to a person's intellect. Without absolute truth there is nothing real to know. While life is a very comprehensive term, here it relates to a person's feelings, emotions, and driving desires of life, such as thirst, hunger, the urge to breathe, the desire to procreate, etc. Of course, the life that Jesus offers goes beyond basic needs to abundant and eternal life. Jesus said that He is the way for us to conduct our lives, He is the absolute truth and knowledge that we seek, and He is the abundant fulfillment of the seemingly endless desires in the struggle to survive.

The wisdom, strength, and riches in Jeremiah 9:23 ([see also](pride.md)) also relate to these three parts of the inner person. Thus, the ideal is that we justly conduct our lives with our God given abilities, that we allow the knowledge of His revealed truth correct our lives, and that we use the abundance of God's resources to show kindness to those who are in need.
