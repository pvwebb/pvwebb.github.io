----------------------------------------------------

<div class="p">So they asked him, "What miraculous sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you? What will you do?" (John 6:30, NIV)

 Context: John 6:25-33</div>Would you like to convince people to believe in Christ? This desire can become an obsession if not tempered by truth. In the desert before Jesus began His ministry, [He resisted this temptation.](temptation.html) However, throughout His ministry people continued to resuscitate the temptation by asking Him to first show them a sign before they would believe (Matthew 12:38; 16:1; Mark 8:11).

When society gives in to this temptation, it loses the vision of truth anchored objectively in God and winning arguments supersedes God's message. A society without absolutes breeds the opinion that people who believe in absolutes are bigoted. Absolute truth has a built in accountability factor for everyone. However, if absolute truth didn't exist, even scientific fact would be subjective. Today, [scientists become frustrated](http://web.archive.org/web/20020605052405/http://www.sciam.com/1998/0398issue/0398profile.html) when people demand their conclusions conform to political correctness rather than to observations from the candid pursuit of knowledge.

The extreme of succumbing to the temptation to convince by any means leads to religion dominated by charlatans. It views deception as OK if it helps convince someone to believe. Deception and dishonesty can never be justified, especially in matters concerning faith. Dishonesty is synonymous with unfaithfulness. Deception is inconsistent with God's character (Hebrews 6:17-18) and distorts any attempt to convey who God is.
