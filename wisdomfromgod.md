-------------------------------------

<div class="p">It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God--that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption. (1 Corinthians 1:30, NIV)

 (Context 1 Corinthians 1:18-31)</div>Do you ever wonder if you're saved? From our human viewpoint it's difficulty to accept Christ's salvation freely without doing anything to deserve it, but God values the internal characteristics of [righteousness, justice, and mercy](pride.html). He bases salvation on righteousness, holiness, and redemption that Christ provided on the cross. His sacrificial death cleansed us from sin so we could clothe ourselves with His holiness. The Biblical account of His righteous life reveals how to live. His indwelling us confirms this truth; not that following Christ's example saves us, but that God works out His goodness within us as He teaches us to desire what He desires. Jesus confirms eternal life through His resurrection.

It's human nature to base salvation on what we see; on external actions. But, God redeems the inner person and lets external good be the outflow of a redeemed heart.
