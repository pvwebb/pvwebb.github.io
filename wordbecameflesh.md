-------------------------------------

<div class="p">The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John 1:14, NIV)

 The Word of God is living and active (Hebrews 4:12-13). Unlike our words, God's words have the power to accomplish His purpose (Isaiah 55:10-11). [God spoke the creation into existence](glory.md). Yet, from the very beginning God's living purpose has existed in the person of Jesus Christ (John 1:1-3). In Jesus the Word of God was a living breathing human being. When Jesus was here, God was living among us as a human being (John 1:18). God showed us how to live (John 1:4-5) by giving us an example as a human being Himself (1 Peter 2:21). He also provided the means for us to become His children (John 1:12-13).</div>  </div>- [Back to home page.](index.md)
